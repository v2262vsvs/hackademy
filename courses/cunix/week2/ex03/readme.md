## My Strcpy

### Objectives
* Learn the C primitives types
* Learn how to use C pointers with Arrays of char
* Learn how to test your code

### Actions
* Go to the course directory `cd cep/courses/cunix/ex03/`
* Read all files in include/ src/ and the Makefile before starting anything
* Create a file src/my_strcpy.c
* Implement strcpy in a file called my_strcpy using the prototype:
`char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);`
* Run `make test`
